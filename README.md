# Lua Toolbox

## Important

This project is deprecated. The website is no longer online (its features [have been merged into the LuaRocks website](https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2016-12-22-goodbye-lua-toolbox.html)) and the source code is not a good reference for how to write a modern Lapis application. It is just there as a historical artifact!

## Presentation

Inspired by [The Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/).

## Usage

Edit config.moon, then start with:

    make dev

Make sure you have a local Redis server running on port 6379, then open http://localhost:8080.

For more, see Makefile and config.moon.
